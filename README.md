# SBillMove
Move and copy pdf files from a location, ran through a Batch file on the task scheduler

Running Setup.py creates a Batch file with the python.exe and SBillMoveRename.py file location. It also automatically creates a Windows Scheduled task to run the copy/move script.

This Script was created for Linden Bulk Transportation.
